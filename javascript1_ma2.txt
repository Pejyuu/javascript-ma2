//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?
		A function literal is a function statement that is used as an expression.
		You'd use this instead of declaring a function.

		I'm not exactly sure when to actually use this, so would appreciate a teacher hitting me up with some more info. The texts I find on the subject does not get the point across to me.

2. What is the constructor?
		A constructor is a method to create and initialize a set of defaults in a object created by a class. Could be considered a class "blueprint".

3. What does the return statement do?
	 	A return statement passes data back out of the function it was in. You'll normally assign this data to a variable for further use.

4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();

		The above code prints this in my console
		- Warning: unreachable code after return statement (Firefox)
		A return-statement stops any further code from running in a function.
		If there is code after a return-statement, it will be declared unreachable and throw an error like the one above.


5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.
		GLOBAL is when a item is accessible GLOBALLY in the script.
		LOCAL is when a item is only accessible LOCALY ( inside ) in the function it was declared in.
